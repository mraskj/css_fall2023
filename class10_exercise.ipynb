        "Recall from the lecture that $F0$ refers to the number of times per second our vocal cords vibrate when making voiced sounds. As the name suggests, voiced sounds refer to sounds that make use of our vocal cords. All vowel sounds are voiced, but not all consonants are. Some consonant sounds, such as /p/, /f/ and /s/ are unvoiced. This means the vocal cords do not vibrate when producing these sounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "For our purpose, we are talking about $F0$ at a higher level than vowels and consonants, typically at the speech level, but other semantic units such as sentences are also likely or fixed temporal segments (e.g. a five second window). Regardless of the level of measurement, the fundamental frequency is called the *fundamental* since it's the dominant frequency in the given time period that we consider.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we saw on the slides, the $F0$ is a strong and robust indicator of emotional arousal. The idea is simple. When a speaker becomes emotional aroused, or if a speaker wants to *project* arousal, $F0$ increases. The link is not necessarily causal, but what matters to us is that arousal is reflected in $F0$. We will explore this idea in this exercise by estimating the pitch of speeches.\n",
        "\n",
        "The fundamental frequency of a sound is closely correlated with pitch. Although some may think that $F0$ is just a fancy word for pitch, others argue that pitch is a different concept. In fact, pitch is more to do with a person's perception of a $F0$. In other words, fundamental frequency refers to the actual physical properties of a sound wave signal, whereas pitch refers to how our ears and brains perceive the signal regarding the rate of frequency.\n",

And the `spitch' column contains standardized pitch estimates for that specific speech computed over speeches from 2000-2021. Hence, hundreds and even thousands of speeches contribute to the score. Recall that standardization scales data to mean zero and unit variance. Sort the computed F0 means from highest to lowest and describe the results.
