# Computational Methods and Analysis of Political Text, Audio and Images
This repository contains material for the graduate course "Computational Methods and Analysis of Political Text, Audio, and Images" taught in the Fall of 2023 at Aarhus University. The course language is Danish 🇩🇰, but all material and slides are available in English 🇬🇧.

The steadily increasing volume of digitized data has fundamentally changed the rules of the game for modern society. 
In this new digital world, human behavior is tracked and stored in abundance in text, audio, and images. 
These new data sources contain crucial information about everything from social norms, political preferences, group affiliations, and much more. 
Unlike traditional data sources such as surveys, text, audio, and images are characterized by their high frequency and volume, enabling us to answer new questions about political life and revisit long-unanswered questions with a range of new tools.

In this course, students learn to work with new data sources such as text, audio, and images using computational methods. 
The course is structured around each type of data and each contains topics such as preprocessing and measurement. 
The aim is that students are able to work with unstructured data sources to answer politically relevant research questions. 
We cover both theoretical foundations of computational methods and applications that use the methods to answer a politically motivated question. 

The course uses a mix of lecture and lab sessions where students are provided with hands-on exercises during class using Python. 
Overall, the course provides students with tools to process and analyze text, audio, and image data using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches.
