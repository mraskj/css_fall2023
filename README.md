This repository contains material for gradudate course "Computational Methods and Analysis of Political Text, Audio and Images" taught in the Fall of 2023 at Aarhus University.


<h2 align="left" id="description">Course Description 📅</h2>
In this course, social science students learn how to analyze unstructured data such as text, audio, and images using computational methods. The course has four blocks. The first block introduces a general framework for developing and validating measures based on high-dimensional data sources. The remaining three blocks centers around text-as-data, audio-as-data, and image-as-data. In each block, students learn how to convert data into a computer-readable and learn how to use machine and deep learning techniques to study its content.

The course uses Python 🐍. The code is implemented using Python 3.8.4 but all 3.x versions should work.

### 1. Create Python3.x environment

`python -m venv .venv` (where `.venv` is the name of virtual environment)

Activate environment using the bash shell:

* `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)

*  `source .venv/bin/activate` (Unix or MacOS)


### 2. Install Requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

⚠️⚠️ Make sure to install the requirements within the environment ⚠️⚠️
