# Computational Methods and Analysis of Political Text, Audio and Images
This repository contains material for gradudate course "Computational Methods and Analysis of Political Text, Audio and Images" taught in the Fall of 2023 at Aarhus University.


<h2 align="left" id="description">Course Description 📅</h2>
In this course, social science students learn how to analyze unstructured data such as text, audio, and images using computational methods. The course has four blocks. The first block introduces a general framework for developing and validating measures based on high-dimensional data sources. The remaining three blocks centers around text-as-data, audio-as-data, and image-as-data. In each block, students learn how to convert data into a computer-readable and learn how to use a selection of machine and deep learning techniques to study its content. 

<h3 align="left" id="block1">Block 1: Development and Validation</h3>
In the first block, students are introduced to a general framework for thinking about and analyzing unstructured data sources for social science purposes. We learn to develop measures of political relevance from text, audio, and image data (e.g. measures of elite polarization) and how to validate these measures. 






<h2 align="left" id="setup">Software Setup ⚙️</h2>
The course uses Python 🐍. The code is implemented using Python 3.8.4 but all 3.x versions should work.

### 1. Create Python3.x environment

`python -m venv .venv` (where `.venv` is the name of virtual environment)

Activate environment using the bash shell:

* `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)

*  `source .venv/bin/activate` (Unix or MacOS)


### 2. Install Requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

⚠️⚠️ Make sure to install the requirements within the environment ⚠️⚠️
