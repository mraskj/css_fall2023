# Computational Methods and Analysis of Political Text, Audio and Images
This repository contains material for graduate course "Computational Methods and Analysis of Political Text, Audio and Images" taught in the Fall of 2023 at Aarhus University. The course language is Danish 🇩🇰, but all material and slides is available is in English 🇬🇧. 


<h2 align="left" id="description">Course Description ✍️ </h2>
In this course, social science students learn how to analyze unstructured data such as text, audio, and images using computational methods. The course has four blocks. The first block introduces a general framework for developing and validating measures based on high-dimensional data sources. The remaining three blocks centers around text-as-data, audio-as-data, and image-as-data. In each block, students learn how to convert data into a computer-readable and learn how to use a selection of machine and deep learning techniques to study its content. 


<h3 align="left" id="block1">Block 1: Introduction</h3>
In the first block, students are introduced to a general framework (DMV) using unstructured data sources for social science purposes. It has three steps: *D*evelopment, *M*easurement, and *V*alidation. We learn to theorize and develop concepts, how to measure the concepts, and how to validate the measures. The first block introduces students to the programming langugage of the course <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_top">Python 🐍</a>.
 

<h3 align="left" id="block2">Block 2: Text-as-Data</h3>
In the second block, we learn about text-as-data. Students are introduced to basic techniques such as bag-of-words and dictionary

<h2 align="left" id="setup">Software Setup ⚙️</h2>
The official programming language of the course is Python 🐍. 

We mostly rely on Google Colab [![Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](), but student should also install :snake: on their local machine. 

<h2 align="left" id="local">Local installation 💻:</h2>

The code is implemented using Python 3.8.4 but all 3.x versions should work.

#### 1. Create Python3.x environment

`python -m venv .venv` (where `.venv` is the name of virtual environment)

Activate environment using the bash shell:

* `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)

*  `source .venv/bin/activate` (Unix or MacOS)


#### 2. Install Requirements


`pip install -r requirements.txt`

⚠️⚠️ Make sure to install the requirements within the environment ⚠️⚠️
